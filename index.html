                <h2>Employment Enablement Services</h2>
                <p>The gap between the industry needs and academia is ever increasing. On one hand, high levels of youth unemployment, and on the other, shortage of people with critical job skills, is a crisis facing every country. Matching the skills imparted by the education providers with the skill needed by the employers has become a big challenge. The entry-level jobs are either not getting filled or getting filled by interim job seekers who do not possess the skills needed for those jobs. Productivity is becoming a casualty, cost of training on the job is adding up to the loss of productivity and as a result, new avenues including that of a high level of automation is being sought out. The students often do not gain confidence and capability from what they study to face the actual world outside and become productive.</p>
                <p>We provide placement assistance to students by interacting with industry players and positioning our skill-based learning programs within the industry.
